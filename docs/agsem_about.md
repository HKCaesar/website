### Agrisemantics working group
The Agrisemantics Working Group within RDA, the [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org), gathers together researchers and practitioners at the crossing point between agriculture and data management. The final output of the group was a [set of community-based requirements to promote the use of semantics for data interoperability, with special focus on agriculture](https://agrisemantics.org/#agsem_recommendations/).

For details about group participants and activities, see the [Agrisemantics WG page at RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/agrisemantics-wg.html). There, you will also find two intermediate outputs of the group: (1) A report on semantics landscape for agricultural data, and (2) A set of use cases and requirements.
