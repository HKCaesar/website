            "text": "39 Hints to Facilitate the Use of Semantics for Data on Agriculture and Nutrition\n\n\nRecommendations from the RDA Agrisemantics Working Group\n\n\nThis document presents the recommendations of the \nRDA Agrisemantics Working Group\n (WG) to promote the use of semantics for agricultural data for the purpose of enhancing data interoperability in agriculture. These recommendations are high-level, to encourage researchers and practitioners to extend them according to their area of expertise.\n\n\nThe activities of the Agrisemantics WG started off with \nan analysis of the current landscape of use of semantic resources with agricultural data\n, based on first-hand experience of our group members, as well as on bibliometric investigation, and an analysis of existing repositories. From that first activity, we found that despite the many possible applications of semantics and the interest shown by research and industry alike, their actual implementation and use is lagging behind. A large number of resources are not in machine-readable formats or do not have public APIs, while those available are often used beyond their intended area of use, possibly leading to problems. Our conclusion is that there is a strong need for \u201clifting\u201d semantic resources to the web, and create new ones appropriate to their intended use.\n\n\nBased on the insights gained from that analysis, we moved on to look in more detail at the actual reality of working with semantic resources, we opened a call for use cases, to collect examples of actual work and limitations, together with evidence of work already ongoing to address them. From that, we found that a large variety of profiles (and so skills and roles) are involved in working with semantic resources, and that there seem to be as many tools and toolkits as projects. Following the explicit suggestions provided by our respondents, we identified three types of implications of this fact, namely:\n\n\n\n\nImplications on software usability\n. Given the variety of profiles involved, tools designed for use with SRs should be accessible to non-ontologists. In particular,\nmore attention should be payed to graphical interfaces, support for validation, and for methodological support in each task.\n\n\nImplications on tools availability\n. Reportedly, not all institutions or organizations can afford the whole set of activities associated to them, online platforms are needed to lift the burden of local (or ad-hoc) installations and maintenance from users or individuals.\n\n\nImplications on tools interoperability\n. From the use cases presented, it emerges that the different tasks commonly required to work with SR are commonly achieved\nby pipelines of different tools. Given this fragmented landscape, we recommend that tools to perform common tasks involving SRs (e.g. editing, format conversion, etc.) should be integrated, or integratable, to form flexible and interoperable workflows. This approach would contribute to minimizing the breadth of skills required to work with SRs.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we distilled our findings into a set of high level recommendations (HLR) for future activities and implementations.\n\n\nHLR1\u200b . \u200b Foster the development of a generic framework to work with Semantic Resources (SRs). This framework should be available online and be easily adaptable\n according to:\n\n\n\n\nthe tasks to perform\n: Tasks along the entire lifecycle of SRs and data should be supported. Examples for SR producers include: conception, editing, update, quality check, validation, metadata creation (preferably automatic), and publication.  Examples for SR consumers include: discovery, mapping, merging and annotation;\n\n\nthe domains to cover\n: Users working with different domains should be able to connect to relevant SR repositories and data type registries;\n\n\nthe user competencies required\n. By providing a large catalog of tools with different levels of complexity, appropriate documentation, methodological tips, and training.\n\n\n\n\nSuch a framework should support \ncollaborative work\n,\u200b and take into particular account the needs of non-specialists of semantics, like domain experts, data managers and application developers (consuming SRs). It should encourage the \u200b\nreuse\n\u200b of existing resources whenever possible to reduce workload and increase interoperability. In order for such tools to effectively extend the framework, the appropriate licencing policy needs to be in place, to ensure the legal interoperability of the framework and the candidate tools for inclusion. The legal interoperability aspect needs to be considered since the beginning of any project or\ninitiative.\n\n\nHLR2. Support initiatives aimed at developing tools and resources for alignment\n (semantic mapping). Activities of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nThe development of \ninnovative tools for creating, validating, and maintaining alignments\n\u200b between two semantic resources or between a dataset and a semantic\nresource. Such tools should integrate state of art algorithms, have user-friendly GUIs,and be as integrated as possible in the working environment of the user.\n\n\nThe promotion of a \nstandard for expressing alignment between SR expressed in little or no machine-actionable formats\n.\n\n\nThe development and long term maintenance of \nlow-level resources\n1\n for common objects of interest in agriculture\n\u200b (e.g., species and varieties, diseases, food products) offering persistent identifiers (PIDs). Supported resources should conform to W3C recommendations and be published according to the FAIR principles.\n\n\n\n\nHLR3. Promote the adoption of common metadata models for the description of semantic resources and alignments, and the use of global identifiers to facilitate reuse, ensure usage tracking, and citation\n. \u200b This is to promote the access and reuse of semantic resources. To this end, improving information on provenance is a priority. A short set of metadata models fitted to describe semantic resources and alignments needs to be gathered and promoted. Whenever needed, existing models should be completed with adequate metadata items to allow, for instance, the production of usage metrics (if not\navailable, they should be created). This should come with a more generalized adoption of persistent global identifiers (PIDs) at various level (e.g., the resource itself, the concepts, mappings, its creators). We do not recommend a specific PID system (as its choice also depends on the needs of the specific application and domains), but do recommend that the\nsystem chosen is widely adopted, and that the possibility of creating correspondences with other systems is taken into consideration since the beginning (especially to increase the possibility of data integration and interoperability). Shared and adapted metadata as well as persistent, global identifiers will contribute to develop better practices in reusing and citing resources in the agri-food domain.\n\n\nHLR4. \u200b Create courses on semantics and integrate them into curricula\n \u200b in computer sciences, data & information management and analytics, agronomy, bioinformatics, etc. This is the condition for a broader adoption of semantics to handle agrifood data. As semantics is needed in all steps of data life cycle, relevant knowledge and skills should be shared by all\nroles involved in the workflow - domain experts and software managers alike. People\ndeveloping software to store, share, integrate and analyze the data must be considered as\n\n\nRecommendation according to profiles and roles:\n\n\nThe recommendations given above are organized according to their area of coverage. In the\nfollowing, we arrange them according the skill sets and roles that in the best position to\nimplement them. At the same time, we also provide more details for as many recommendations as possible.\n\n\nPlease note\n, all recommendations are available for discussion via the issue tracker on our  \ngit repository\n. Please do get involved!\n\n\n1. \nDevelopers of tools for manipulating semantic structures\n\n\nWe wish to address software engineers, from both academia and industry, who produce tools and platforms to conceive, edit, merge, map, and share semantic resources. With these recommendations, we intend to guide them towards easier-to-use, more interoperable,\nsmarter technologies for the benefit of non experts in particular. A table of correspondences between the more specific recommendations given below and the \nRequirements listed in Deliverable 2 can be found in Annex I\n.\n\n\nGeneral recommendations\n\n\n\n\nBuild \ntools that may be integrated into suits\n, to \u200b unburden users from tasks such as format transformation and transfer of metadata. Integratable tools should be available at all phases of the editing process, e.g., eliciting knowledge, formalization, reuse and alignment. This implies \u200b\nchoosing standard technologies and shared input/output formats\n for both content representation (e.g. \nSKOS\n and \nTEI\n ) and metadata encoding.\n\n\nUse \u200b\nopen source\n licenses that will facilitate , at a minimum, allow for the integration of your software into pipelines and public e-infrastructures.\n\n\nBuild \u200b\ntools that support known best practices for the task at hand\n, \u200bincluding the implementation of FAIR principles, and for reusing, citing and providing SR with\nmetadata and documentation\u200b,\u200b distinguishing conceptual from linguistic content\u200b.  Implement FAIR metrics to assign level of FAIRness to SRs\n\n\nProvide\n\u200b (if possible, multilingual) \ndocumentation on your tools and toolkits\u200b\n. Make it possible for third parties (e.g., e-infrastructure developers) to provide user support when needed.\n\n\n\n\nUsability\n\n\n\n\nConsider non-semantic experts\n (e.g. biologist, agronomist) when \u200b\ndeveloping tools\n. \u200b Tools should be user-friendly both at the level of software interaction and through graphical interfaces that use understandable terminology. \u200b Tools should smoothly support those users in a number of activities, such as bulk edits, or editing\nby drag & drop. A cloud-based platform (with no local installation required) also contributes to the usability of tools, especially if also collaborative features are\nimplemented.\n\n\nImplement \u200b(semi)automatic generation of metadata\n and transfer protocols to pass metadata on from one tool to another. Duplicated effort in recording metadata at different stages of SR creation and reuse must be avoided.\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nGuide users in choosing appropriate format and modelling approach\n to represent a SR. For example, OWL may be too expressive for a vocabulary that could be effectively modelled as a SKOS resource, and conversely, an OWL \u200bfile, \u200bdoes not necessarily imply an ontology.\n\n\nAllow for the \u200b\ncustomization\n\u200b of editing and alignment tools, such as the possibility of (de)activate features according to the nature of the SR to be edited (e.g., simple lists, thesauri, formal ontologies).\n\n\nInclude automatic \nquality check\n\u200b on both structure and content of SR, by allowing for reuse of existing tools and algorithms (e.g. for \nSKOS\n, \nqSKOS\n and \nSkosify\n).\n\n\nConnect tools or services to SR repositories in the user\u2019s domain(s) of interest in order to facilitate the reuse of resources (e.g., terms, concepts, low-resources) whenever possible, instead of creating new content.\n\n\nImplement notification mechanisms to inform users, both human and applications, when a new version of a SR is available.\n\n\nInclude concept/class \u200b\nalignment\n\u200b advanced features in SR editing tools, integrate state-of-art alignment algorithms. In particular, consider the alignment of resources of different levels of expressiveness, e.g. thesauri with ontologies. Allow for \ncollaborative evaluation\n\u200b of alignments.

            "text": "This document presents the recommendations of the  RDA Agrisemantics Working Group  (WG) to promote the use of semantics for agricultural data for the purpose of enhancing data interoperability in agriculture. These recommendations are high-level, to encourage researchers and practitioners to extend them according to their area of expertise.  The activities of the Agrisemantics WG started off with  an analysis of the current landscape of use of semantic resources with agricultural data , based on first-hand experience of our group members, as well as on bibliometric investigation, and an analysis of existing repositories. From that first activity, we found that despite the many possible applications of semantics and the interest shown by research and industry alike, their actual implementation and use is lagging behind. A large number of resources are not in machine-readable formats or do not have public APIs, while those available are often used beyond their intended area of use, possibly leading to problems. Our conclusion is that there is a strong need for \u201clifting\u201d semantic resources to the web, and create new ones appropriate to their intended use.  Based on the insights gained from that analysis, we moved on to look in more detail at the actual reality of working with semantic resources, we opened a call for use cases, to collect examples of actual work and limitations, together with evidence of work already ongoing to address them. From that, we found that a large variety of profiles (and so skills and roles) are involved in working with semantic resources, and that there seem to be as many tools and toolkits as projects. Following the explicit suggestions provided by our respondents, we identified three types of implications of this fact, namely:   Implications on software usability . Given the variety of profiles involved, tools designed for use with SRs should be accessible to non-ontologists. In particular,\nmore attention should be payed to graphical interfaces, support for validation, and for methodological support in each task.  Implications on tools availability . Reportedly, not all institutions or organizations can afford the whole set of activities associated to them, online platforms are needed to lift the burden of local (or ad-hoc) installations and maintenance from users or individuals.  Implications on tools interoperability . From the use cases presented, it emerges that the different tasks commonly required to work with SR are commonly achieved\nby pipelines of different tools. Given this fragmented landscape, we recommend that tools to perform common tasks involving SRs (e.g. editing, format conversion, etc.) should be integrated, or integratable, to form flexible and interoperable workflows. This approach would contribute to minimizing the breadth of skills required to work with SRs.   Now, we distilled our findings into a set of high level recommendations (HLR) for future activities and implementations.  HLR1\u200b . \u200b Foster the development of a generic framework to work with Semantic Resources (SRs). This framework should be available online and be easily adaptable  according to:   the tasks to perform : Tasks along the entire lifecycle of SRs and data should be supported. Examples for SR producers include: conception, editing, update, quality check, validation, metadata creation (preferably automatic), and publication.  Examples for SR consumers include: discovery, mapping, merging and annotation;  the domains to cover : Users working with different domains should be able to connect to relevant SR repositories and data type registries;  the user competencies required . By providing a large catalog of tools with different levels of complexity, appropriate documentation, methodological tips, and training.   Such a framework should support  collaborative work ,\u200b and take into particular account the needs of non-specialists of semantics, like domain experts, data managers and application developers (consuming SRs). It should encourage the \u200b reuse \u200b of existing resources whenever possible to reduce workload and increase interoperability. In order for such tools to effectively extend the framework, the appropriate licencing policy needs to be in place, to ensure the legal interoperability of the framework and the candidate tools for inclusion. The legal interoperability aspect needs to be considered since the beginning of any project or\ninitiative.  HLR2. Support initiatives aimed at developing tools and resources for alignment  (semantic mapping). Activities of interest include, but are not limited to:   The development of  innovative tools for creating, validating, and maintaining alignments \u200b between two semantic resources or between a dataset and a semantic\nresource. Such tools should integrate state of art algorithms, have user-friendly GUIs,and be as integrated as possible in the working environment of the user.  The promotion of a  standard for expressing alignment between SR expressed in little or no machine-actionable formats .  The development and long term maintenance of  low-level resources 1  for common objects of interest in agriculture \u200b (e.g., species and varieties, diseases, food products) offering persistent identifiers (PIDs). Supported resources should conform to W3C recommendations and be published according to the FAIR principles.   HLR3. Promote the adoption of common metadata models for the description of semantic resources and alignments, and the use of global identifiers to facilitate reuse, ensure usage tracking, and citation . \u200b This is to promote the access and reuse of semantic resources. To this end, improving information on provenance is a priority. A short set of metadata models fitted to describe semantic resources and alignments needs to be gathered and promoted. Whenever needed, existing models should be completed with adequate metadata items to allow, for instance, the production of usage metrics (if not\navailable, they should be created). This should come with a more generalized adoption of persistent global identifiers (PIDs) at various level (e.g., the resource itself, the concepts, mappings, its creators). We do not recommend a specific PID system (as its choice also depends on the needs of the specific application and domains), but do recommend that the\nsystem chosen is widely adopted, and that the possibility of creating correspondences with other systems is taken into consideration since the beginning (especially to increase the possibility of data integration and interoperability). Shared and adapted metadata as well as persistent, global identifiers will contribute to develop better practices in reusing and citing resources in the agri-food domain.  HLR4. \u200b Create courses on semantics and integrate them into curricula  \u200b in computer sciences, data & information management and analytics, agronomy, bioinformatics, etc. This is the condition for a broader adoption of semantics to handle agrifood data. As semantics is needed in all steps of data life cycle, relevant knowledge and skills should be shared by all\nroles involved in the workflow - domain experts and software managers alike. People\ndeveloping software to store, share, integrate and analyze the data must be considered as",

With these recommendations, we intend to guide them towards easier-to-use, more interoperable,\nsmarter technologies for the benefit of non experts in particular. A table of correspondences between the more specific recommendations given below and the  Requirements listed in Deliverable 2 can be found in Annex I .  General recommendations   Build  tools that may be integrated into suits , to \u200b unburden users from tasks such as format transformation and transfer of metadata. Integratable tools should be available at all phases of the editing process, e.g., eliciting knowledge, formalization, reuse and alignment. This implies \u200b choosing standard technologies and shared input/output formats  for both content representation (e.g.  SKOS  and  TEI  ) and metadata encoding.  Use \u200b open source  licenses that will facilitate , at a minimum, allow for the integration of your software into pipelines and public e-infrastructures.  Build \u200b tools that support known best practices for the task at hand , \u200bincluding the implementation of FAIR principles, and for reusing, citing and providing SR with\nmetadata and documentation\u200b,\u200b distinguishing conceptual from linguistic content\u200b.  Implement FAIR metrics to assign level of FAIRness to SRs  Provide \u200b (if possible, multilingual)  documentation on your tools and toolkits\u200b . Make it possible for third parties (e.g., e-infrastructure developers) to provide user support when needed.   Usability   Consider non-semantic experts  (e.g. biologist, agronomist) when \u200b developing tools . \u200b Tools should be user-friendly both at the level of software interaction and through graphical interfaces that use understandable terminology. \u200b Tools should smoothly support those users in a number of activities, such as bulk edits, or editing\nby drag & drop. A cloud-based platform (with no local installation required) also contributes to the usability of tools, especially if also collaborative features are\nimplemented.  Implement \u200b(semi)automatic generation of metadata  and transfer protocols to pass metadata on from one tool to another. Duplicated effort in recording metadata at different stages of SR creation and reuse must be avoided.   Features   Guide users in choosing appropriate format and modelling approach  to represent a SR. For example, OWL may be too expressive for a vocabulary that could be effectively modelled as a SKOS resource, and conversely, an OWL \u200bfile, \u200bdoes not necessarily imply an ontology.  Allow for the \u200b customization \u200b of editing and alignment tools, such as the possibility of (de)activate features according to the nature of the SR to be edited (e.g., simple lists, thesauri, formal ontologies).  Include automatic  quality check \u200b on both structure and content of SR, by allowing for reuse of existing tools and algorithms (e.g. for  SKOS ,  qSKOS  and  Skosify ).  Connect tools or services to SR repositories in the user\u2019s domain(s) of interest in order to facilitate the reuse of resources (e.g., terms, concepts, low-resources) whenever possible, instead of creating new content.  Implement notification mechanisms to inform users, both human and applications, when a new version of a SR is available.  Include concept/class \u200b alignment \u200b advanced features in SR editing tools, integrate state-of-art alignment algorithms. In particular, consider the alignment of resources of different levels of expressiveness, e.g. thesauri with ontologies. Allow for  collaborative evaluation \u200b of alignments. Implement the \u200b use of metadata and recording of provenance \u200b of concepts in alignment processes.  Add \u200b alignment discovery services  that deal with SPARQL endpoints and develop algorithms and tools to \u200b mine large sets of alignments .",

Scientific\nnames may be expressed as \"Latinate\" (Latin or Latin-like) phrases, such as\n\"Tsuga canadensis\" or \"Picea engelmannii\".  Exceptions include viruses, which\nare translingually named in English, e.g., \"Foot-and-mouth disease virus\".  If\nthe goal of GACS were to provide a definitive database for species or taxons,\nit might follow relevant standards such as Darwin Core, which designates\nscientific names with a special property.  In order to meet the simpler use\ncases of bibliographic indexing, GACS follows the thesaurus paradigm of\nconcepts with preferred and alternate labels.  Insofar as scientific names are\ntranslingual, they are considered in GACS as belonging to no language in\nparticular.  Labels with scientific names are tagged with a code, 'zxx',\ndefined in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 for content that is not specific to any\nlanguage (@cite).\n\n\nIn GACS, the distinction between preferred and alternative labels is largely\northogonal to the distinction between scientific and common names.  A\nscientific name may be the preferred label (e.g., \"Leptinotarsa decemlineata\")\nand the corresponding common name the alternative (\"Colorado potato beetle\").\nVice versa, the common name may be preferred (\"dogs\") and the scientific name\nalternative (\"Canis lupus familiaris\").\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Condition                    | prefLabel                 | altLabel                  |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1:1 Common to Species Name   | __Species__               | __Common__                |\n|                              | Leptinotarsa decemlineata | Colorado potato beetle    |\n|                              | Camelus bactrianus        | Bactrian camel            |\n|                              | Quercus rubra             | Northern red oak          |\n| 1:N Common to Species Name   | __Species__               | __Common__                |\n|                              | Campanula                 | Bluebells                 |\n|                              | Barleria                  |                           |\n|                              | Mertensia                 |                           |\n|                              | Eustoma                   |                           |\n|                              | Hyacinthoides             |                           |\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLori Finch prepared a note about \ncommon names and Latin names in\nGACS\n.",

Moreover, narrative definitions are less\nuseful than semantic relations for automated processing because relations\nbetween concepts can only roughly be computed from label strings, sentence\nparsing, and the co-occurrence of words.  \n\n\nExplicit semantic relations provide a basis for browsing broader, narrower, or\nrelated concepts and for expanding queries.  They can be used to disambiguate\nmeanings and to check concept hierarchies for consistency.  Because they\ncluster related examples, they are less vulnerable than definitions to\nmisinterpretation by translators.  In GACS, definitions are \"nice to have\", but\nsemantic relations are essential.  For maintainability, the set of semantic\nrelations used in GACS has been kept as simple and obvious as possible.\n\n\nBroader, narrower, and related concepts\n\n\nGACS concepts are linked among themselves with \nrelated\n, \nbroader\n, and\n\nnarrower\n relations as defined in SKOS, which are themselves based on standard\nthesaurus relations (\nRT\n, \nBT\n, and \nNT\n).  \nBroader\n and \nnarrower\n do not\nformally distinguish between \"is a\" and \"part of\" relations.

While top concepts, with their hierarchies,\nmight in principle be used to group concepts by the type of thing they\nrepresent, such as \"organisms\", the GACS hierarchy does not follow the\nprinciple of general-to-specific (hyponymy) strictly enough to ensure that \"is\na\" (\"type of\") relations always hold; the hierarchy also contains \"part of\"\n(meronym) relations.  The GACS Working Group opted to explore the usefulness of\nconcept types by creating types of SKOS concept for just four particularly\nobvious and clearly defined types of things: \nChemical\n, \nGeographical\n,\n\nOrganism\n, and \nProduct\n, with \nTopic\n as a fifth \"catch-all\" type for all\nconcepts not otherwise covered (and with the expectation that \nTopic\n might be\nfurther differentiated over time).\n\n\nCustom (non-SKOS) relations between concepts\n\n\nSome thesauri, such as AGROVOC and CAB Thesaurus, use semantic relations beyond\nstandard SKOS properties to express more specific relations between concepts.\nHowever, efforts to \"ontologize\" thesauri with such additional relations\nstruggle to ensure that the properties would be applied consistently,\ncomprehensively, and maintainably.  The GACS Working Group decided that custom\nrelations should only be created for use cases important enough to justify the\neffort.  Two properties qualified: \nhasProduct\n and \nproductOf\n, for relating\n\nfish as a product\n to \nfish as an\norganism\n.\n\n\nMapping to concepts in external vocabularies\n\n\nGACS was created at the intersection of three existing thesauri, and each\nconcept in GACS has a SKOS \"exact match\" relation back to the concept or\nconcepts in AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT from which it was created.  \n\n\nIn addition, the 540 concepts of type \nGeographical\n have SKOS \"close match\"\nrelations to entities in Wikidata.

As a SKOS concept scheme, GACS\nidentifies its concepts with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for use in\nLinked Data.  GACS Beta 3.1, published in May 2016 with 15,000 concepts and\n350,000 terms (labels) in over 25 languages, will soon be superseded by \nGACS\n4.0\n, the result of\na recent \nGACS Quality Improvement Project\n.\n\n\nCreated since 2014 on the initiative of three organizations, the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Centre for\nAgriculture and Biosciences International (CABI), and the USDA National\nAgricultural Library (NAL), GACS was formed at the intersection of\nmost-frequently-used concepts from their three respective thesauri -- the\n\nAGROVOC Concept Scheme\n, \nCAB\nThesaurus\n, and the \nNAL\nThesaurus\n, for which GACS provides a mapping\nhub.\n\n\nGACS is seen as an important step towards linking and integrating agricultural\ndata of all types to address the long-term challenge of global food security.\nThe GACS community of maintenance organizations is growing.  The GACS community\naspires to build collaboration with expert providers of concept URIs in\nspecific areas such as species, viruses, chemicals, and geographic places.",
